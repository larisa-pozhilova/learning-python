## Why Python?
Python is a powerful, easy-to-learn programming language that's widely used in fields like web development, data science, automation, and artificial intelligence. Its readability and large community make it an ideal language for beginners and experts alike.

## Learning Goals
1. Understand the basics of Python syntax and programming principles.
2. Learn about data types, variables, and control flow.
3. Get comfortable with functions, loops, and conditional statements.
4. Explore Python libraries and frameworks, such as NumPy and pandas.
5. Build foundational projects to reinforce my learning.
